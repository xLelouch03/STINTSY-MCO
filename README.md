This project involves an end-to-end machine learning pipeline focusing on the analysis and classification of pumpkin seed data. Through various steps—such as exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, model training, and hyperparameter tuning—we aim to develop an effective model that can classify pumpkin seeds accurately and provide meaningful insights into the dataset.
